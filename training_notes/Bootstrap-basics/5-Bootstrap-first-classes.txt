in a div tag we can classify it as :

class="container"
We use the container class to keep content within a fixed width on the screen, determined by the size of the screen
we can put many rows in container 

class="row"

each row span 12 colomns (default but can be changed) we control the spanning by class col-
.....................................

class="col-12 col-sm-6" |-> means for extra small screen the row spans 12 (whole screen)
						|-> for small screen and above 	the row spans 6
						
.....................................
we can do this :

<div class="col-12 col-sm-3 col-md-6 col-lg-9"> </div>

<div class="col col-sm col-md col-lg"> </div>

			|-> means for extra small screen the row spans 12 (whole screen)
			|-> for small screen row spans 3 and 6 for midum and 9 for larg
			|-> the div tag after this will span [[what is left]] in each screen size

.....................................

class="col-auto"  : it will span enough coloumns as is required by the content 


.....................................

by adding to the class name the following it makes different effects:

order-(size)-(first\last)  |-> it changes the order of the row based on the size 


offset-(n)	|-> the content of the tag will be pushed right by the n columns


align-self-*	|-> horizontal adjusting 
align-items-*	|-> horizontal adjusting 


justify-self-*	|-> vertical adjusting 
justify-items-*	|-> vertical adjusting 


display property:

.d-{value} for xs
.d-{breakpoint}-{value} for sm, md, lg, and xl.

Where value is one of:

none
inline
inline-block
block
table
table-cell
