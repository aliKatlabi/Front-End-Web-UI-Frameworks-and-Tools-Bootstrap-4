when designing a navigation bar we need <nav> or <div role="navigation">

in the <nav> we specify the class as navbar (which allows to creat the bar) +

navbar-expand-{sm-md-lg} 	: to tell at which breakpoint it is going to collapse 
navbar-{dark-light}			: choose light or dark color 
bg-(color)					: add a background color

Sticky top/Fixed bottom/Fixed top : position of the navbar


.....................................

the content (children) of the <nav> are also supported

.navbar-brand		: to add the brand of the product or the company
	
.navbar-nav			: define the main navigation in <ul> tag for example 

.nav-item 			: can be put for the items of the navbar-nav (for <li> tags)
.nav-link 			: can be put for the links belong to nav-items (for <a> tags in <li>)

.active : hielight the link to indicate the active page
