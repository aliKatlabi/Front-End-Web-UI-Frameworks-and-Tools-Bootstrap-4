Setting up the Project Folder
Go to a convenient folder location on your computer and download the Bootstrap4-starter.zip file using the link provided at the top of this page.


Unzip the file to see a folder named Bootstrap4 

Move to the conFusion folder.

Open a cmd window/terminal and move to the conFusion folder.
At the prompt type

		npm install		//This will install the lite-server node module to your project

Next, 
initialize a Git repository in the project folder, and 
then set up a .gitignore file with the contents as shown below:

node_modules

Now do a commit 

install JQuery and Popper.js 

		npm install bootstrap@4.0.0 --save
		npm install jquery@3.3.1 popper.js@1.12.9 --save

This will fetch the Bootstrap files and store is in your node_modules 

The bootstrap->dist folder contains the precompiled Bootstrap CSS and JS files for use within your project.



Open your project folder in your editor, and then open the index.html file in the conFusion folder. This is your starting web page for the project. We have already created the web page with some content to get you started. We will use Bootstrap to style this web page, and learn Bootstrap features, classes and components along the way.
Start your lite-server by typing npm start at the prompt. The index.html file should now be loaded into your default browser.
