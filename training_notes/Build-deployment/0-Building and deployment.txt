the aim is to not repeat our selves .
We need a build tool to auto run the repetitve tasks.

commmon tasks for CSS :

- compiling scss or less into CSS.
- we may need to run autoprefixer(to add any vendor prefixer that is needed) for issues that might arrise in various browsers.
- minification : removing unnecessary charechters (white spaces, newlines, comments) from source code without comprimising functionality [[it migth make it hard to read]].
- Concatenation : group all css files into one css file only.

common tasks for javascript:

- JSHint : static code analyses (checking code for errors )
- Concatenation: make a one big JS fie 
- Uglification: minification + Mangling (reducing names of variables into single letter)
- rechecking for errors

Other tasks :

- Otimizing files to reduce file size (like in images case ).
- Watching : watching for changes in files and automatically rerunning tasks.
- Server and liverload : we need the ability to serve up the code and render it atutmatically in the browser like in (lite-srever)
- testing 
- Building the site for deployment
